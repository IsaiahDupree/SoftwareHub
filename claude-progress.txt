# SoftwareHub - Claude Agent Progress Log

## Session 1: Initializer Agent (February 10, 2026)

### Objective
Set up the environment for autonomous coding agents. Analyze requirements, validate infrastructure, create documentation, and prepare the development roadmap.

### Completed
- [x] Full codebase exploration and audit
- [x] Reviewed feature_list.json (120 features, 12 inherited/passing, 108 to implement)
- [x] Reviewed PRD.md and PRD_DETAILED.md
- [x] Reviewed product inventory (11 software products with PRDs)
- [x] Fixed CLAUDE.md port documentation (API: 54821, Studio: 54823)
- [x] Fixed .env.example (site URL, Supabase port, added Stripe publishable key)
- [x] Added LICENSE_JWT_SECRET to .env.local and .env.example
- [x] Created docs/TDD_TEST_SUITE.md (120 test specifications)
- [x] Created docs/PRD_ASSESSMENT.md (implementation assessment)
- [x] Initialized claude-progress.txt
- [x] Validated build infrastructure (npm run build)
- [x] Validated test infrastructure (npm run test)
- [x] Created products/seed_packages.sql (seed data for 11 products)

### Issues Found & Fixed
1. CLAUDE.md had incorrect Supabase port numbers (documented 28321, actual 54821) - FIXED
2. .env.example had wrong site URL (localhost:3000 instead of localhost:2828) - FIXED
3. .env.local contains live Stripe keys - not a git issue (in .gitignore) but developers should use test mode keys for local dev
4. Missing TDD_TEST_SUITE.md and PRD_ASSESSMENT.md referenced in CLAUDE.md - CREATED
5. Missing LICENSE_JWT_SECRET env var needed for licensing features - ADDED
6. lib/certificates/generatePDF.ts used JSX in .ts file - RENAMED to .tsx, build now passes
7. app/admin/offers/new/page.tsx missing stripe_price_id in emptyOffer - FIXED, build now passes
8. 11 test suites failing (116 tests) - pre-existing from Portal28, not blocking

### Build Status
- `npm run build`: PASSING (after fixes #6 and #7)
- `npm run test`: 52/63 suites pass, 1224/1343 tests pass (11 pre-existing failures)

### Feature List Status
- Total: 120 features
- Passing: 12 (inherited from Portal28)
- To Implement: 108
- Critical Path: Phase 1 (Database) -> Phase 2 (APIs) -> Phase 4 (Stripe) -> Phase 5 (Licensing)

### Recommended Next Session
**Session 2 should implement Phase 1: Database Foundation (sh-001 to sh-010)**
- Create 8 new database tables via Supabase migrations
- Create database helper functions
- Apply all migrations and verify schema
- Seed initial product data

### Files Modified
- CLAUDE.md (port fixes: API 54821, Studio 54823)
- .env.local (added LICENSE_JWT_SECRET)
- .env.example (site URL, Supabase port, added NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, LICENSE_JWT_SECRET)
- lib/certificates/generatePDF.ts -> .tsx (renamed for JSX support)
- app/admin/offers/new/page.tsx (added missing stripe_price_id)

### Files Created
- docs/TDD_TEST_SUITE.md (comprehensive test specs for all 120 features)
- docs/PRD_ASSESSMENT.md (implementation assessment and roadmap)
- claude-progress.txt (this file)
- products/seed_packages.sql (11 products ready to seed into packages table)
